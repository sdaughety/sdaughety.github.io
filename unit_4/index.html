		<h2>Purpose</h2>

		<p>I would like to create a website that contains recipes my kids and grandkids repeatedly request.  I would also like to include short stories about me and our family that they may not remember.  Hopefully, this site will become something they will enjoy and that will continue to grow.  I plan to include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Favorite Recipes</li>
			<li>Food and Family Photographs</li>
			<li>Family Stories</li>
		</ul>	

		<p>One of my daughter's recently commented that she didn't realize that I had gone to graduate school and had earned my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering.  There are probably lots of things my children don't remember about their lives growing up or don't know about me, their dad.  This website will attempt to fill in some of the gaps.</p>

	<img src="http://www.egglandsbest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Classic_Deviled_Eggs.jpg" alt="deviled eggs" title="plate of deviled eggs">

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>8 large peeled hard boiled eggs</li> 
		<li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon white-wine vinegar</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
		<li>Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper</li>
		<li>Paprika for garnish</li>
		<li>Optional:  1/4 cup minced red onion</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Directions</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>In a medium bowl, mix mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, and hot sauce.</li>
		<li>Halve the eggs lengthwise.</li>  
		<li>Remove the yokes and add them to the mayonnaise mixture.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mash with a fork until smooth.</li>
		<li>Mound the yolk mixture into the egg whites.</li>
		<li>Sprinkle with paprika.</li> 
		<li>Provide minced red onion on the side.</li>
	</ol>  

	<p>Serve and enjoy!</p>

	<h3>Tips</h3>

	<p>Boiled eggs peel easiest if eggs are 1 1/2 to 2 weeks old when you boil them.</p>

	<p>After mashing the egg yokes into the mayonnaise mixture the mixture won't be completely smooth.  Let the mixture stand for 15-30 minutes.  The bits of egg yokes will be absorbed.  Simply stir and then fill the egg whites either with a spoon or a piping bag.</p>

	<p>You can cover the filled egg whites with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to eight hours.  Remove the plastic wrap, sprinkle with paprika, and serve.</p>
